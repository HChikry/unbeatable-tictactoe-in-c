2. Open the program folder in the terminal.
3. Run the game using this command:

- For MacOS
```
bin/src/mac/./main
```

- For Windows
```
bin/src/win/./main.exe
```

## Compile The Game (If You Couldn't Run It)

1. You will need to have a gcc compiler installed in your machine.
2. Open the program folder in the terminal.
3. Compile the game using this command:

- For MaxOS
```
gcc -o bin/src/mac/main ./src/main.c ./src/computer_turn/unbeatable_mode.c ./src/computer_turn/normal_mode.c ./src/computer_turn/computer_moves.c ./src/computer_turn/computer_turn.c ./src/common/err.c ./src/common/graphic.c ./src/common/form.c ./src/game_play/game_checkers.c ./src/game_play/user_turn.c ./src/game_play/game_play.c ./src/game_play/saving_gameplays.c ./src/friends_gameplay/friends_gameplay.c ./src/friends_gameplay/multiple_player_game_checkers.c
```

- For Windows
```
gcc -o bin/src/win/main.exe ./src/main.c ./src/computer_turn/unbeatable_mode.c ./src/computer_turn/normal_mode.c ./src/computer_turn/computer_moves.c ./src/computer_turn/computer_turn.c ./src/common/err.c ./src/common/graphic.c ./src/common/form.c ./src/game_play/game_checkers.c ./src/game_play/user_turn.c ./src/game_play/game_play.c ./src/game_play/saving_gameplays.c ./src/friends_gameplay/friends_gameplay.c ./src/friends_gameplay/multiple_player_game_checkers.c
